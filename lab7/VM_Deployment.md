# VirtualBox Installation and Version

VirtualBox was already installed on my Ubuntu OS. The version of VirtualBox installed is `Version 7.0.6 r155176`. For those who need to install VirtualBox, it can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

# VM Deployment and Configuration

I created a new Virtual Machine (VM) using VirtualBox. For this setup, I chose to install the Ubuntu `23.10.1` ISO file to test it, as I already have Ubuntu `22.04.3`. The following configurations were made during the VM setup:

- Allocated `4096 megabytes of memory`.
- Allocated `2 CPU cores`.
- Network configuration was set to use my wired connection directly without any additional configuration.
