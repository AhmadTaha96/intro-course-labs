# VirtualBox Version

The virtualbox was already installed on my Ubantu OS, the version I have is ```Version 7.0.6 r155176```

# Deployment and Configuration

I have installed the iso file of Ubantu ```23.10.1``` to test it as I have already have ```22.04.3```, I have allocated ```4096 mega bytes of memory``` and ```2 cores of cpu``` and it was connected through wired connection (as I am using wired connection) directly without any configuration from my side.

The following image demonstarte the running system and the configuration side by side.
