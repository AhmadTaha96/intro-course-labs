## Definition and Purpose

Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to files over time. Every time we make changes to the project and save them in a VCS, it records a snapshot of the files at that time. This allows to revisit old versions, track changes, and even undo mistakes.

## Benefits and Advantages in a Collaborative Environment

1.  **Backup**: All changes are saved, so one wonâ€™t lose his work.
2.  **Teamwork**: Multiple people can work on the same project without messing up each other's changes.
3.  **History**: One can see who made which changes, why they were made, and when.
4.  **Mistake Fix**: Made a mistake? No worries! Go back to an older version.
5.  **Testing**: Try out new features without messing up the main project.

## Types of Version Control Systems:

1.  **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**: Everyone connects to a central server to get the latest version or to save changes. Something like a library where one person can "check out" a file at a time.
    -   Example: Subversion (often called SVN).
2.  **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**: Everyone has a personal copy of the entire project. One can work offline, make changes, and then share those changes with others.
    -   Example: Git, Mercurial.

## Comparison of Popular Version Control Systems:

1.  **Git**: Very popular, It's distributed, so everyone has their own copy of the project. Many online platforms like GitHub and GitLab use Git.
2.  **Subversion (SVN)**: Older and centralized. It's like a big shared folder where everyone can get and save files. It's not as common as Git, but some companies still use it because they've always used it.
3.  **Mercurial**: Also distributed, like Git. It's easy to use and similar to Git, but not as widely adopted.

To summarize it In short, version control systems are likes saving buttons for the project, making teamwork and collaboration easier and safer. With a lot of features, they boost teamwork, and maintain the consistency and tracking of code. There are diverse tools and forms, including Git, SVN, and Mercurial, each providing unique features to match specific project needs.
