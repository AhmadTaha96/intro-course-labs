3. **Initiate New Website Creation**
   - Once we logged in, we click on "Add new site".

4. **Select Repository**
   - We choose the repo name that was previously forked.

5. **Hosting Service Selection**
   - Choose "IPFS" as our hosting service.

6. **Deployment Settings**
   - Under the deployment settings:
     - **Branch**: left as default (typically `main` or `master`).
     - **Basic build settings**: No changes made, we went with the default options.
   - Finally, we click "deploy" to initiate the deployment process.
